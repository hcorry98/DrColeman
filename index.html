        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Dr. Brock Coleman, the medical student at the University of Utah and
          DM extraordinaire, may have a knack for saving lives and slaying dragons,
          but his culinary skills are a whole other story. Rumor has it that he's
          so bad in the kitchen that his smoke alarm doubles as a cooking timer.
          If he ever offers to cook you dinner, just remember to bring a fire
          extinguisher and a pack of antacids.
        </p>

          Dr. Brock Coleman may be a medical student by day, but by night he
          transforms into a fearless DM leading his DnD crew through epic battles
          and treacherous quests. But his love of fantasy doesn't stop there,
          because rumor has it that he once spent an entire weekend perfecting
          his Gandalf impression, complete with a flowing white beard and staff.
          Let's just hope he doesn't start confusing his medical diagnoses with
          spells from his wizarding handbook!
